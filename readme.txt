This is clownfysh::cf, by Matthew Temple.  These are tools I use to build
things.  They're free; use them however you like.  For more, visit:

--[ top-level systems ]--------------------------------------------------------

    bin :: environment, makefile, scripts
  chage :: chaos game engine
inferno :: search, classify, morph
  sorea :: os human-human, human-machine interface
 struct :: ...
      x :: base library :: containers, networking, etc.

--[ setup ]--------------------------------------------------------------------

set up your environment
  + set $CF to the directory where you checked out this project (the directory
    containing this file)
  + add $CF/bin to $PATH (needed for the build)

install
  + OS development headers (stddef.h etc.), and set $CF_C_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR
    to the place on your OS that includes them
    (for example: /usr/lib/gcc/i486-linux-gnu/4.2.4/include)
  + an ANSI C compiler                  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_C )
  + DirectFB                                       ( http://www.directfb.org/ )
  + IJG JPEG                                            ( http://www.ijg.org/ )
  + ncurses                            ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses )
  + OpenSSL                                         ( http://www.openssl.org/ )
  + POSIX Threads                ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads )
  + PostgreSQL                                   ( http://www.postgresql.org/ )
    + compile with --enable-thread-safety
    + set $CF_POSTGRESQL_INCLUDE_DIR to the directory containing libpq-fe.h
      (for example: /usr/include/postgresql)
  + rsync                                ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync )

develop and compile
  + "cd $CF"
  + "make help"
  + if you want to commit back to the project
    + read and follow the guide below
    + "make test", "make release" and "make clean" before committing

--[ style ]--------------------------------------------------------------------

formatting
  + use k & r style, except:
    + indent with two spaces
  + use braces around single-statement parts of if-then
  + use "f() {}" (open/close braces on the same line) to show that there is no
    plan to implement this function
  + no whitespace at the end of a line
  + for multiline critical blocks, format like this:
    lock();
    {
        do-stuff();
        do-more-stuff();
    }
    unlock();

structure
  + in a function, use four blocks sepetated by double newlines
    + four blocks
      + assert preconditions and do declarations (with no initialization)
      + initializations (casts, then other initializations)
      + main business
      + assert postconditions and return
    + if the whole function is three lines or less, or the whole function body
      is one statement, don't use double newlines to separate the blocks
  + in a file, place things in this order:
    + #ifndef (if an .h file)
    + #includes
    + #defines
    + enum declarations
    + struct declarations
    + static variable declarations
    + static function declarations
    + function definitions
  + alphabetize functions by name in .h and .c files

terms
  + the highest level directory "cf" is called a project
  + lower-level directories are called "systems"
  + a .h/.c/.test.c triplet is associated with a "module"

naming
  + name modules like project_domain_module (h_core_set)
  + name functions like domain_module_verb or module_verb_noun
    (h_core_set_add_object())
  + create/get/get_as functions
    + a get_x() function returns a value or pointer that the providing object
      manages
    + a get_x_copy() function returns a pointer that the caller manages
    + a get_as() function returns a a value or pointer that the caller manages
      + uuid_get_as_string()
    + a create() function returns a value or pointer that the caller manages
      + string_create_from_uuid()
  + in a container, "replace" means remove, then add; or find, remove, then add
  + ii or jj for naming indexes is prohibited :: use something short like i, j,
    ax, bx, or use something like "object" or "each_object", or "object_index"
  + use "_size" to name a variable/function that indicates the size of
    something including any terminator characters; use "_length" to name a
    variable/function that indicates the number of characters in a string,
    excluding the terminator character
  + if there's one main executable in a system named xyz, name the executable's
    main program source xyz.c
  + name a system's central logical module "system" (with system.h/system.c/
    system.test.c)

logic
  + in a system that has a create() function, always have a destroy() function;
    in a system that has an init() function, always have a free() function and
    always call the free function even if the free function doesn't do anything
    right now...it might someday
  + one return per function, at the end of the function, no guard clauses
  + test every return condition
    + no need to test these unless you want to:
      + h_core_trace(), h_core_trace_exit()
      + h_core_log_enter(), h_core_log_trace()
    + don't test these:
      + get() functions where the value is guaranteed to be there by a
        precondition :: like, it's returning a pointer to, or copy of,
        something that is already guaranteed to be there
      + a h_core_map_find() where a precondition guarantees that that item is
        there...like as the result of an sql query, where you've checked the
        return value of the query() function
    + we're not testing pthread_mutex_[un]lock() right now...
  + don't initialize things until/unless you need to
  + don't use the const keyword
  + use assert()s to express preconditions unless it's a one-line function...no
    need to specify postconditions using assert()s...there are some functions
    that do this, they're from an older time
  + logging
    + use h_core_trace(), h_core_trace_exit(), and h_core_log_trace() when you
      want to report an error :: an error is defined as when you call a
      function and it returns a value that indicates that it didn't do what you
      wanted it to do
      + the only text you pass to a trace message is the name of the function
        you called that returned an error
    + use h_core_log_enter() for everything else
    + prefer h_core_log_enter() and h_core_log_trace() over h_core_trace() and
      h_core_trace_exit()
    + only use h_core_trace_exit() in a file that contains a main()
  + put constants first when using == operator (0 == c)
  + sizeof(char) is always 1 :: don't multiply anything by sizeof(char)
  + no comments in completed code--if you need comments it's because the
    identifiers are named improperly, except:
  + put a default: block in every switch statement, followed by at least a
    break;
  + when referring to paths/urls/directories, always start with a slash, never
    end with one
  + generally, don't use straight int's, use short or long
    + (might be nice to actually use uint32, that sort of thing...I mean just
      to make it clear what's happening in network-serialization type
      situations)
  + generally, do one thing per line
    + generally, don't use the tertiary operator
    + generally, don't use the comma operator
    + generally, set a variable to the return value of a function, then use
      that variable in the call to another function, rather than nesting
      function calls
  + generally, code for what you want to happen, not what you don't want to
    happen
  + don't use static keyword on function definitions
